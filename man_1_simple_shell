DESCRIPTION
       simple_shell is a simple UNIX shell that executes commands
       read from the standard input or from a file. It can handle
       only a small selection of commands and operations. The
       output mirrors that of sh and has the same error output.
       The shell can be run in both interactive and
       non-interactive modes. This shell was created as a project
       for Holberton School.

       exit [status]
       * Exits the shell with the specified status (default 0).

EXIT STATUS
       The following may be returned:
       0 - Success
       1 - Failure
